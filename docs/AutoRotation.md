# Auto Rotation

Auto Rotation is a tool inside Wrath that allows wrath to automatically perform
your rotation with active input from you, the player. The settings for this are located
on the left-hand column of wrath and allow you to customize what Auto Rotation will do for you.

## Setting up your Auto Rotation Settings
> [!TIP]
> At the Very bottom of the settings page is Throttle Delay. This determines how fast
> Auto Rotation "presses the button." Setting this too low can tank your FPS.
